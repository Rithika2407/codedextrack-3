Predicting 2024 Paris Olympics Winners Using 2021 Tokyo Data



This project aims to predict the medal winners of the 2024 Paris Olympics by analyzing the 2021 Tokyo Olympics dataset. We will leverage comprehensive data from the 2021 Olympics, including athletes, events, countries, and performance metrics. Our hypothesis is that historical performance, athlete development, investment in sports, and participation in international competitions are key predictors of Olympic success.

This project combines data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning to provide actionable insights and predictions for the 2024 Paris Olympics, leveraging historical data from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.

The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. We will use statistical models and machine learning algorithms to identify the most significant predictors and create predictive models. Visualization tools will help illustrate trends, correlations, and predictions, providing clear insights into potential outcomes for the 2024 Olympics. The final report will summarize findings, methodologies, and predictive insights, helping stakeholders understand the factors influencing Olympic success and make informed predictions for future events.
